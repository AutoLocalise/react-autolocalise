- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps

- List any additional requirements

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
- Follow the TypeScript and React styleguides
- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests
- Document new code
- End all files with a newline

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo

   git checkout -b my-branch-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- Use explicit type annotations when type inference would lead to overly complex types
- Follow the existing code style

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Follow the existing testing patterns

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

- `bug` - Issues that are bugs
- `enhancement` - Issues that are feature requests
- `documentation` - Issues that are about documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
